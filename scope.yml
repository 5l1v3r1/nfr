# This configuration file sets the NFR monitoring scope
# Groups can be used to assign labels to different networks (e.g. default, pci_zone, etc.)
#
# Within each group, you can define:
# - IP address space to monitor DNS traffic from
# - IP address space to exclude (e.g. mail servers and systems repeating requests)
# - Whitelisted domains (e.g. internal trusted domains that don't need to be scored)
#
# DNS traffic from addresses within scope and for non-whitelisted domains will be sent to
# the AlphaSOC DNS Analytics API for scoring. You can use this configuration file to limit
# and control data sent to the API.
#
# If you have any questions, please contact support@alphasoc.com for assistance.
