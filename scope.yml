#
# This is the Network Flight Recorder (NFR) monitoring scope file. Here you create
# arbitrary groups of systems to monitor. For each group you should then define:
#
# - Source IP address ranges to monitor events from
# - Source IP address ranges to exclude from scoring (if any)
# - Trusted destination domains to whitelist (e.g. internal domains)
# - Trusted destination IP ranges to whitelist (e.g. known good destinations)
#
# Only network events from the source addresses within scope to non-whitelisted
# destinations are sent to the AlphaSOC Analytics Engine for scoring.
#
# Please contact support@alphasoc.com if you have any questions
#

groups:

  # Short arbitrary label for the group (e.g. default:, pci_zone:, guest_wifi:)
  default:

    # Long label describing the group, for use in alerts and UI elements
    label: "Default"

    # Source IP ranges of networks in scope, in CIDR slash-notation format
    # We default to internal private ranges here, but you can use 0.0.0.0/0 to
    # monitor all of the things.
    in_scope:
    - 10.0.0.0/8
    - 192.168.0.0/16
    - 172.16.0.0/12
    - fc00::/7

    # Source IP ranges of systems to exclude from monitoring in CIDR
    # slash-notation format (i.e. use "- 1.2.3.4/32" to suppress a single system),
    # written as a list in the same format as the in_scope section above.
    # This exclusion list is intended to suppress scoring of events from
    # recursive resolvers, mail servers, proxies, and other systems that
    # generating noise or repeating queries that are being captured elsewhere.
    out_scope:

    # Trusted destination domains which are whitelisted and ignored by the
    # DNS analytics module. Use this list to whitelist your internal domains, etc.
    trusted_domains:
    - "*.arpa"
    - "*.lan"
    - "*.local"
    - "*.internal"

    # Trusted destination IP ranges (in CIDR slash-notation format) which are
    # whitelisted and ignored by the IP analytics module. By default these are
    # private networks, so that we process Internet-bound traffic to flag anomalies.
    trusted_ips:
    - 10.0.0.0/8
    - 127.0.0.0/8
    - 169.254.0.0/16
    - 172.16.0.0/12
